##Description
This code was written for our bachelor thesis. The data used in the study isn't included in the repo. Data can be downloaded from NeuroMorpho.Org. Some functions have predefined pathings and also are connected to our specific datasets. Therefore you will need to modify the code a bit to make it compatible with your given data.
